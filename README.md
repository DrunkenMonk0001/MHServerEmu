## Features

MHServerEmu is in active development. Currently it features:

- Playing as any hero available in version 1.52.

- Basic combat mechanics: using powers, dealing direct damage to enemies. More complex powers, such as those that rely on debuff effects or summoned allies, are currently not implemented.

- Leveling from 1 to 60 with working dynamic combat level (enemy level scaling).

- Summoning team-ups and vanity pets.

- AI system for non-playable characters, such as enemies and team-ups.

- Fully-featured implementation of DRAG (dynamic random area generator) with procedural enemy population spawning.

- Implementation of the loot system that uses the original loot tables for picking quality and base types, as well as rolling random affixes.

- SQLite-based persistence layer for saving accounts, player data, avatars, items, and more. An optional JSON mode for offline single-player is also available.

- Multiplayer functionality: you can see and interact with other players connected to the same server in hubs and public combat zones. Parties and coop in private instances are currently not implemented.
